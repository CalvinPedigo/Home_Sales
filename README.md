# Home_Sales
# UofU Data Analytics Module 22 Challenge
This challenge looks at csv data regarding home sales to determine key metrics about them. Primarily using spark, this jupyter notebook file will create a series of queries in both standard spark and parquetted versions to compare speeds. I create temporary views, practice caching and uncaching tables, and run queries using spark.sql to achieve this. All the code is contained within the "Home_Sales" file.
